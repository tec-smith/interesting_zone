Any environment variables that might be required by this project will be provided within an example environment file.

You are advised to view the ``pubspec.yaml`` for build information, including plugins used. Any changes to this file will be logged in the change log, above.

Please consider it an invitation for a contribution, should you feel up to the challenge!
